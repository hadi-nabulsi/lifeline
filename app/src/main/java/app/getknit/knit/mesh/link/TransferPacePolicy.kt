/**
 * Pure, JVM-testable feed-pacing for a streamed file over a link — the average byte-rate limiter that keeps a
 * bulk transfer from monopolising a slow, shared channel.
 *
 * [FramedLink.streamFile] already interleaves live frames between file chunks, but on the Bluetooth **L2CAP CoC**
 * plane that interleaving is defeated below the app layer: `BluetoothSocket.getOutputStream().write()` buffers
 * into the local socket → BT-stack TX queue and returns, so the writer dumps a whole small blob into that queue
 * in a burst — a frame enqueued *afterwards* lands behind the entire file and only reaches the wire once it
 * drains ("text arrives only when the transfer completes"), and the saturated ACL starves the reverse direction
 * too. Pacing the file feed below what the air drains keeps that queue shallow: interleaved frames sit near the
 * wire head and the freed connection-event budget carries reverse traffic. The stack's queue holds hundreds of KB
 * before a write blocks, so the sender cannot see the drain; it is the receiver's `rx … in <ms>ms` line that
 * measures it, never the sender's `file … in` line, which reads size ÷ pace (#117).
 *
 * Kept free of Android and of a clock (the caller stamps `elapsedMs` from the link's injected `now`), like
 * [app.getknit.knit.mesh.bluetooth.ConnectBackoffPolicy], so the curve is asserted with the same unit-test
 * style. The Wi-Fi Aware NDP socket is fast and must not be throttled, so it runs unbounded
 * ([PaceConfig.bytesPerSec] ≤ 0).
